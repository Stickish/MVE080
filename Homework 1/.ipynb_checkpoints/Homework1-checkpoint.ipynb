    "1. It describes the tasks.\n",
    "2. It (sometimes) provides coding templates that you can use as a basis for your own code.\n",
    "3. It is a template also for the report that you upload in Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are of various types: some are to read some text and then comment on it (no coding), and some are about creating visualizations using plotnine.\n",
    "Once you're finished with all the tasks, export this document as an HTML-file and upload it in Canvas.\n",

    "## Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Chapter 1-3 of [Fundamentals of Data Visualizations](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/), then answer the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.1\n",
    "Describe the visualization concept _scales_. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.1\n",
    "A scale is a one to one mapping between data and aesthetics, examples of scales are positions and shapes. The one to one part is important since if the data isn't mapped one to one the representation becomes ambiguous. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.2\n",
    "In Figures 2.3 and 2.4 the same data is visualized in two different ways. Discuss the pros and cons of the two approaches. Which one do you prefer and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.2\n",
    "The two figures, in my opinion, serves two different purposes. Figure 2.3 is clearer if we are interested in the peaks and lows over the whole year. While Figure 2.4 it is easier to see and compare trends on a smaller scale, since it is hard to know exactly what day/month you are looking at in Figure 2.3 due to the labels being so spread apart. Finding the maximum or exact values in 2.4 would be extremely difficult since it is harder to in our heads map the exact nuance of color to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.3\n",
    "Describe situations when _nonlinear axes_ might be useful.\n",
    "When should they not be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.3\n",
    "Nonlinear axes like the logarithmic one is useful when points are spaced very close together, taking the logarithm will space them out more. It is also useful when depicting exponential data, since it makes it easier to see \"how\" exponential a line is for example. The logarithmix transformation is also useful when plotting ratios since a linear scale obfuscates the differences between two datapoints with a ratio $<1$ for example 0.01 and 0.05 can be hard to tell apart if the scale goes from $[0,1000]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logartithmic scales should be avoided when zeros occur in your data since $\\mathrm{ln}(0) \\rightarrow\\infty$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.4\n",
    "In which situations could a _polar coordinate system_ be useful? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.4\n",
    "Polar coordinates are especially good at capturing periodic sequences another use case could be when plotting imaginary numbers since they can be representet as $z = r e^{i\\theta}$. \n"
